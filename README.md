# Single-Layer-Perceptron-implemented-in-python-
This is implemented for OR AND NAND and NOR Problems 
This algorithm intialize the weights randomly and perfrom execution on them and update the weights accordingly during iterations.
It perform iterations untill stopping conditon is meet
in the output the weights and bias is printed after each iteration.

Its Enough
